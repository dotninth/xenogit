## Introduction
`Xenogit` is your helpful command-line assistant that uses [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) GPT to quickly create commit messages that follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. Stop spending time writing commits and start managing your Git repository effortlessly!

## Ô∏èGetting Started
### Installing
There are two ways to install Xenogit:

1. **Using Composer:** Run the following command to install Xenogit globally:

```shell
composer global require dotninth/xenogit
```

2. **Downloading from GitHub:** Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/dotninth/xenogit/releases) on GitHub and download the appropriate binary.

## Usage
After installing Xenogit, you can all available options by simply launcing the program:

```shell
$ xenogit

  Xenogit  v1.3.0

  USAGE:  <command> [options] [arguments]

  commit         Automatically generate commit messages

  config:api-key Configure the API key in the .env file
```

## API Key
Xenogit needs an [API key from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to work properly. There are two options to provide the API key:

1. Use the command `xenogit config:api-key <your-api-key>`.

2. Using environment variable: Create an environment variable called `API_KEY` that contains your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

3. Create a file named `.env` in the directory where the Xenogit binary is located. This file will be used to store your environment variables. To the `.env` file, add the following line, replacing `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys):

```shell
API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## v2.0.0 - Notes
1. Rename the `xenogit` command to `xg`.
2. Improve the prompt and move response to JSON.
3. The goal of the program is stacked PRs workflow with AI integration:
    - AI helps with writing commits and writing PRs.

Using Xenogit will cost you money for each request you make to the OpenAI API. Xenogit uses the official ChatGPT (`gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`) model, which costs approximately 15 times less than GPT-4. Make sure you have enough funds or credits in your OpenAI account to pay for your usage of Xenogit.

To find out more about the price for using OpenAI's services, please check their pricing page at [OpenAI Pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing).

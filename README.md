## Introduction

`Xenogit` is your helpful command-line assistant that uses [Google Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) to quickly create commit messages.
Stop spending time writing commits and start managing your Git repository effortlessly!

<br />

## Ô∏èGetting Started

### Installing

There are two ways to install Xenogit:

1. **Using Composer:** Run the following command to install Xenogit globally:

```shell
composer global require dotninth/xenogit
```

2. **Downloading from GitHub:** Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/dotninth/xenogit/releases) on GitHub and download the appropriate binary.

<br />

## Usage

After installing Xenogit, you can all available options by simply launcing the program:

```shell
$ xenogit

  Xenogit  v2.2.0

  USAGE:  <command> [options] [arguments]

  commit         Automatically generate commit messages

  config:api-key Configure the API key in the .env file
```

```shell
$ xenogit help commit

Description:
  Automatically generate commit messages

Usage:
  commit [options]

Options:
  -m, --model[=MODEL]              Set the ID of the model to use (optional). Default: gemini-2.0-flash
  -t, --temperature[=TEMPERATURE]  Set the temperature (optional). Default: 0
  -k, --tokens[=TOKENS]            Set the maximum number of tokens to use (optional). Default: 100
  -h, --help                       Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command
  -q, --quiet                      Do not output any message
  -V, --version                    Display this application version
      --ansi|--no-ansi             Force (or disable --no-ansi) ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction             Do not ask any interactive question
      --env[=ENV]                  The environment the command should run under
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose             Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug
```

<br />

## Currently available models

You can use 3 models from Google that you can use with the `-m` flag:

- Gemini 2.0 Flash - `gemini-2.0-flash`
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite - `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking - `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking`
- Gemini 2.0 Pro - `gemini-2.0-pro`

> [!NOTE]
> Note that **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking** takes longer and costs more to generate a commit. But if you have a huge set of changes (huge commit), it works best.

<br />

## API Key

Xenogit needs an [API key from Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to work properly. There are two options to provide the API key:

1. Use the command `xenogit config:api-key <your-api-key>`.

2. Using environment variable: Create an environment variable called `API_KEY` that contains your [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

3. Create a file named `.env` in the directory where the Xenogit binary is located. This file will be used to store your environment variables. To the `.env` file, add the following line, replacing `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey):

```shell
API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

<br />

## Payment

Using Xenogit will cost you money for every request you make to the Gemini API. Xenogit uses the official Gemini 2.0 (`gemini-2.0-flash`) model, which is the best model in terms of price/quality ratio. At least for the task Xenogit solves.

You can also use Free Tier for Gemini. Be sure to check for limitations and be aware that Google will use your data to improve their products.

To find out more about the price for using Google's services, please check their pricing page at [Gemini Pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing).

## Bash aliases example

To simplify common workflows, such as adding files to git and committing them, I recommend creating bash aliases.

Here are mine _(sort of a mnemonic for aliases)_:

```zsh
alias xc="xenogit commit"
alias axc="git add . && xc"
alias xcp="xc && git push"
alias axcp="axc && git push"
```
